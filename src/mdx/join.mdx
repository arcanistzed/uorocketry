Do you want to be a member of the uORocketry team? If yes, you are at the right place! The uORocketry team is actively recruiting people to work on our exciting projects. Before completing the form to join us (link at the bottom of the page), we highly encourage you to read the description of each subteam to have a better idea of what we do and what you could work on ðŸ™‚.

## Payload

Whatâ€™s the point of a rocket if you donâ€™t put anything cool inside? Well, payload is dealing with that problem. Our past projects include hemolyzing blood to assist with the Marrow project, attempting to create a rocket-launched drone as well as participating in the Canada Reduced Gravity Experiment (CAN-RGX) to investigate the effect of microgravity on the antibiotic resistance of E. Coli. Basically, if you can think of something really cool to put on the rocket, we will.

As a result of the diverse projects, this team does anything and everything to suit a variety of interests. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Mechanical Design
* Electrical Design
* Software and UI
* Microbiological Experiments
* Control Systems

## Flight Dynamics

The goal of Flight Dynamics is to use math to predict reality. This subteam works on creating software models of rocket components and using these models to simulate the rocketâ€™s flight. The aim of this is to help with anything from predicting landing locations to optimizing our rocket engine.

On the Flight Dynamics team you could be working on:

* Creating MATLAB models to predict the flight of our rocket
* Creating MATLAB models to predict the combustion processes in our engine
* Integrating experimental data into our models
* Using simulation data to optimize our rocket

## Propulsion

The beginnings of rocketry are synonymous with the beginnings of rocket engines: devices that abuse Newtonâ€™s third to move things around. The propulsion subteam works to build the next generation of uORocketryâ€™s hybrid rocket engines - which will be used to compete at SA CUP and beyond.

On the propulsion team, you could be working on:

* Design, develop, and analyse the hybrid engine
* Design and select feed/valving/tanks
* Optimize and manufacture fuel
* Design test equipment

## Avionics

If itâ€™s a circuit or a line of code, itâ€™s avionics. This subteam handles the design and implementation of our flight computer, printed circuit board design, code, and all of the telecommunications between the ground and the rocket. The team also develops testing electronics for the other subteams to facilitate their testing.

On the Avionics team, you could be working on:

* Our new antenna tracking system
* Programming the main flight computer of the rocket in C++
* Telemetry system, radios and ground station

## Recovery

Launching a rocket isn't our only goal. We also need to get it back in one piece. Recovery is responsible for returning our rocket safely to the ground. This subteam designs and builds parachutes, pyrotechnic fasteners, and parachute ejection systems. Recovery also designs testing rigs and performs tests of our unique inverted-reefed parachute and itâ€™s deployment systems.

On the recovery team, you could be working on:

* Designing parachute deployment mechanisms
* Designing and sewing novel parachutes
* Designing and building test equipment
* Leading/participating in many, many tests (hands-on and super fun!)
* FINANCE
* More money = more better! Help us out with cost-tracking, budget planning, marketing, and attracting sponsors.

## Airframe

An engineer knows how to design and manufacture a part. Thatâ€™s what we do!! Airframe is responsible for designing and manufacturing the internal rocket structure. This subteam also runs simulations and analyzes structural parts. The subteam specializes in Solidworks and Ansys, and maintains the CAD. If you are interested in mechanical design, this subteam is the one!!

On the Airframe team, you could be working on:

* Designing the internal the rocket
* Running different simulations (Structural, Topology, Thermal, etc.) using ANSYS and SOLIDWORKS to ensure the designs work!
* Designing tubes and nosecones using composite analysis
* Working with other subteams to make sure they fit inside the rocket :)
* Machining parts and fabricating the rocket
* Contacting vendors to ensure the proper manufacturing of different parts
* BEING COOL!
